    <h1>Salad</h1>

    <p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce fruits and veggies that are so good on
        their own that you dont need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to
        brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days
        when I would rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect solution: they are simple to
        toss
        together, but they are totally delicious nonetheless.</p>
